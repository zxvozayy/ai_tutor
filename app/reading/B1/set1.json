And that means you need support, expert help and a community.\n\nBest Body Fitness isn't just a gym: it's a full-service fitness membership made for you.\n\nHere's how it works:\n\nSTEP ONE: Your assessment\nWe begin with an assessment session. This is a chance for you to see what we do at Best Body. Our assessment plans are no-cost and no-risk. We'll also make a training plan specifically for you.\n\nSTEP TWO: Your training\nWhen you decide to become a Best Body member, we show you what to do, how to do it and why you are doing it. After a few sessions with an expert private trainer you will feel comfortable working out on your own. But don't worry, we'll always be nearby if you have questions.\n\nSTEP THREE: Your membership\nMembership works on a month-to-month basis. There are no sign-up fees and no cancellation fees. Start and stop whenever you want. And the best part? Our fees are the most competitive in the whole downtown area.\n\nSTEP FOUR: Your community\nAt Best Body Fitness, we see everyone as part of a big team. And when you work with a team, you can do great things. Join any of our specialised classes, led by expert instructors. Come to our nutrition classes. Participate in our regular social events. Everything is included in your fee.\n\nFinally, we wanted to share with you some reasons why our members say that they have chosen us over any other fitness centre in the city.\n\nIt's so EASY\nEasy to start, stop, cancel or refund a membership\nEasy to access – we're open 24/7, we never close\nEasy to do exercise – we have lots of equipment, no long wait\nEasy results – our trainers and equipment give you success, fast\nEasy to find – in the centre of town, near public transport and with parking\n\nIt's WONDERFUL\nWonderful members\nWonderful trainers and staff\nWonderful equipment\nWonderful energy\nWonderful location\n\nCome and visit us for a personal tour!",
