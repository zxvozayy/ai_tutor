It must be no bigger than 55cm x 22cm x 35cm and weigh no more than 10kg.\n\nYou can also take one small laptop bag or handbag that can fit under the seat in front of you. If you have two bags, their total weight cannot be more than 10kg. If your bag is too big or too heavy, you will not be allowed to take it onto the plane. Staff will put it in the hold for you and you will have to pay extra.\n\nPlease make sure mobile phones and other devices are fully charged so that security staff can check them.\n\nLiquids in bottles bigger than 100ml are allowed on board if you buy them in the airport shops after you've passed security.\n\nWe hope you enjoy your flight!",
