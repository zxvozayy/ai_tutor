  "title": "The Illusion of Neutrality in Algorithmic Decision-Making",
  "passage": "In recent decades, algorithmic decision-making systems have quietly embedded themselves into the infrastructure of modern life. From determining which job applicants are shortlisted to influencing credit approval, medical diagnoses, and even judicial sentencing, algorithms are frequently presented as objective arbiters, immune to human prejudice. This perception, however, rests on a fragile assumption: that mathematical processes are inherently neutral.\n\nAlgorithms do not emerge in a vacuum. They are designed, trained, and refined by humans, using data produced by social systems that are themselves shaped by historical inequalities. As a result, algorithmic outputs often reproduce, amplify, or obscure biases rather than eliminate them. A system trained on employment data from a discriminatory labour market, for instance, may learn to associate competence with demographic traits that reflect past exclusion rather than genuine ability.\n\nThe opacity of many algorithmic models further complicates accountability. Unlike human decision-makers, who can be questioned and challenged, complex machine-learning systems frequently operate as so-called \"black boxes\". Their internal logic may be technically interpretable only by specialists, if at all. This creates a paradox: the more sophisticated an algorithm becomes, the harder it is for those affected by its decisions to understand or contest its conclusions.\n\nProponents argue that algorithms merely mirror the data they are given and that the solution lies in improving datasets rather than questioning automation itself. Critics counter that this framing deflects responsibility. Decisions about which variables to include, how outcomes are defined, and what constitutes acceptable error are normative choices, not technical necessities. Treating them as neutral disguises ethical judgement as engineering.\n\nAt the highest level, the debate is not about whether algorithms can be useful, but about how societies choose to distribute authority. Delegating consequential decisions to machines may increase efficiency, but it also risks eroding democratic oversight. If fairness is reduced to statistical optimisation and accountability is outsourced to code, then the promise of objectivity may ultimately conceal a deeper loss: the capacity to collectively question how decisions ought to be made at all.",
